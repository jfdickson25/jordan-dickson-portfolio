    'NA', 
    'You will want to start with a 2-4 pound sugar pumpkin (they work best for roasting because they are smaller than carving pumpkins, 
    but really, any old pumpkin will do).  Cut in half, scoop out the seeds and stringy stuff and lay them face down on a cookie sheet.  
    Place the cookie sheet in the oven at 350-375.  Depending on the size of the pumpkins it will take 45-60 minutes to roast.  You will 
    know when they are done because the skin of the pumpkin will get wrinkly.  If you can easily stick a fork in it, then it’s probably done.  
    You want it to be soft, but not gooey.  Set aside until it’s cool enough to handle, then peel the skin off the pumpkin and put the cooked 
    flesh in the blender to puree.  This works the blender pretty hard, so it’s not for a wimpy blender.  It works best if you start on a slow 
    speed until the bottom part starts to puree, then gradually increase the speed until you get to the puree setting.  Let it run until it is 
    really smooth.  At this point, you can use it for your favorite recipe or save it for later.  I usually pack 2 cups (most of my recipes call 
    for a large can, which is pretty much 2 cups) in a pint size mason uar and freeze it.  You could actually can it yourself, but I use mine up 
    before the holidays are over, so I don’t go to that much trouble.  It will keep for a few days in the fridge, but if you need it to last 
    longer than that, just pop it in an airtight container or freezer bag and stick it in the freezer for a few months.    
    2   3lb sugar pumpkins will yield about 5 pint jars of puree.', 2);
