/*Harissa Sweet Potato Pita Pockets
2 Sweet Potatoes
1 Garlic Clove
1/2 oz. Dill
3 tbs. Mayonnaise
2 Whole Wheat Pitas
1 tbsp. Harissa Powder
1 Cucumber
1 Avocado
5 tsp. White Wine Vinegar
1 oz. Pine nuts
2 tsp. Olive Oil
Salt
Pepper

Wash and dry all produce. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Slice sweet potatoes into ¼-inch-thick rounds. 
Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp harissa powder (we’ll use more later), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast 
in oven until tender, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through. Mince or grate 1 clove garlic (we sent more). Halve cucumber lengthwise, 
then slice into thin half-moons. Pick and roughly chop enough fronds from dill to give you 2 tsp. Halve, pit, and peel avocado, then thinly slice.
In a small bowl, combine 3 TBSP mayonnaise (we sent more), a pinch of garlic, and a pinch of harissa powder. Give mixture a taste and add more 
garlic and harissa powder as desired. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, toss cucumber, chopped dill, vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil, 
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cut pitas in half to create 4 pockets and place on another baking sheet. When sweet potatoes are almost done, 
after 18-20 minutes of roasting, put pitas in oven. Toast until warmed through but not crispy, 2-3 minutes. TIP: If there’s room, you can place 
pitas on the same baking sheet as sweet potatoes instead of on a second sheet. Spread harissa mayo inside each pita half, then fill with sweet 
potatoes, avocado, a few pine nuts, and a small amount of cucumber salad. Divide stuffed pitas between plates. Add remaining cucumber salad to the 
side and sprinkle with remaining pine nuts.*/
